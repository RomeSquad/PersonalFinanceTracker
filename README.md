# 💰 Personal Finance Tracker (CLI) - Rome

Welcome to the **Personal Finance Tracker**, a collaborative, console-based application developed to help users manage their personal finances effectively. This project is designed with a strong emphasis on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and adherence to **SOLID principles**, following the **Git Flow** branching strategy throughout the development lifecycle.

---

## 🎯 Project Mission

As a squad, our mission is to collaboratively design and implement a **single-user CLI-based Personal Finance Tracker**, focusing on clean architecture, proper OOP structure, and robust Git practices to ensure maintainable, scalable, and testable code.

## 🧱 Architecture & Design Principles

This application is built with:

- 🧩 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- 📐 **SOLID Design Principles**
- 🔌 **Dependency Inversion**: All modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
- 📦 **In-memory Storage**: Easily swappable due to proper abstraction of the storage layer.
🗃️ JSON File as a Database: Data is serialized/deserialized from a transactions.json file,
